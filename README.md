# Curator-Service-Api-Client

Curator-Service-Api-Client is an API client factory for services registered in *ZooKeeper* via *Curator Framework* or *Spring Cloud ZooKeeper*, featuring **Service Discovery** and **Load balancing**.

## What's This

Usually, services are registered in ZooKeeper at *'/services'* like the following structure:

```
/services
/services/account-service
/services/account-service/ddb643f3-6240-428b-9083-b13e6db2230
/services/account-service/466885c8-1589-40ed-8310-c10b487d050b
```

> If you don't know how to register services in ZooKeeper. You can use *Spring Cloud ZooKeeper*, or *Curator Framework (with Service Discovery Extenstion)* directly.

You try to call its RESTful API on them, but without any mood to dealing with instance discovery and load-balancing.

You want a client factory to create one for you!


## Features

* Service instances discovery is based on *Curator Framework* directly. *Spring Cloud* is **NOT** required. In our testing, *Spring Cloud* forces you to enable web environment to discover other service instances which means you have to start web environment and listen on a port.
* If more than one instances are found in ZooKeeper, every API-call selects the next service instance (Round-Robin).
* The change of service instances will be automatically reflected in the coming API calls even after the client is created. It is the basis, of course.
* Protect your investment to re-use your *Retrofit* Java interface definition. You can easily remove this project off your dependencies when you decide to use *Retrofit* only, hope not.
* Support fixed list of server urls in testing if ZooKeeper environment is not passed in.
* Loosen *Retrofit* standard. Both `Call<T>` and `T` are supported as return type.
* (Optional) A simple service instance registration helper for a common web application to register itself.

## Usage

### Add Dependency

Add the following dependency to your project. Java SDK 1.8 or up is required.

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>tech.hillview</groupId>
  <artifactId>curator-service-api-client</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.8</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'tech.hillview:curator-service-api-client:0.1.8'
```

### Prepare an API interface

Have your API client annotated in [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) style.

```java
public interface AccountServiceApi {
    @POST("account")
    Long createAccount(@Body AccountCreationRequest request);

    @GET("account/{accountId}")
    AccountInfo getAccount(@Path("accountId") Long accountId);
}
```

**NOTE**: You can also use classic Retrofit `Call<T>` as return type. But do **NOT** mix them in the same interface. We cannot implement mixing style without modifying Retrofit itself.

### Apply @ApiClient annotation

```java
@ApiClient(service = "account-service", path = "/api/v1/", url = "http://localhost:8080")
public interface AccountServiceApi {
    // ...
}
```

Annotation properties:

* service: service name registered in ZooKeeper `/services`
* path: a path prefix. It is prepend before the target url defined in @GET/@POST
* url: a list of server address (host:port). This is optional if you only use ZooKeeper to find service instances.
* errorBodyType: the Class<?> of the errorBody. The body of an error http response (4xx, 5xx) will be converted to this type via JacksonMapper. The default value is `String.class` which means no conversion required.

> All java classes provided by this project are under package *tech.hillview.api.curator.client*

### Create ApiClientFactory

```java
CuratorFramework curator = CuratorFrameworkFactory.newClient(zkUri, ...);
curator.start();
curator.blockUntilConnected();

ApiClientFactory apiClientFactory = ApiClientFactory.create(curator); // The concrete implementation is in ApiClientFactoryImpl
```

If no curator is provided (or null), the ```url``` property on @ApiClient annotation is used to locate service instances.

### Create ApiClient implementation

```java
AccountServiceApi accountApi = apiClientFactory.create(AccountServiceApi.class);
```

All's done. Now you can call:

```java
accountApi.getAccount(500L);
```

> If HTTP response error (4xx or 5xx) is caught, an ApiServiceException is thrown out. If IO error occurs, an ApiCallException is thrown out.

## Spring Integration

We provide a scanner to create and register `@ApiClient` bean automatically. So you can `@Autowired` these clients later.

```java
@Bean
public CuratorFramework curatorFramework() throws InterruptedException {
  final String zkUri = "localhost:2181";
  CuratorFramework curator = CuratorFrameworkFactory.newClient(zkUri, new ExponentialBackoffRetry(2000, 15));
  curator.start();
  curator.blockUntilConnected();
  return curator;
}

@Bean
public ApiClientFactory apiClientFactory(CuratorFramework curator) {
  return ApiClientFactory.create(curator);
}

@Bean
public ApiClientBeanRegister scanner(ApiClientFactory apiClientFactory) {
  ApiClientBeanRegister register = new ApiClientBeanRegister();
  register.setApiClientFactory(apiClientFactory);
  register.setPackageNames(new String[] { "tech.hillview.api.curator.client.test" });
  return register;
}
```

In your service code:

```java
@Service
class UserService {

  @Autowired
  private AccountServiceApi accountServiceApi;

  // ...
}
```

Note:

* The client implementation returned from `ApiClientFactory.create()` is **Thread-Safe**. You need only one such instance for each service. Best used in singleton pattern with IoC framework, such as *Spring Framework* or *Guice*.
* The creation of *CuratorFramework* instance is not necessary if you are using *Spring Cloud ZooKeeper*. Re-use it if possible.


## Service Registration

Since v0.1.7, we also provide a helper class to simplify service registration operation for a common application.

```java
private void registerService() {
    serviceRegister = ServiceRegister.create(curator);
    ServiceRegisterHelper.registerHttpService(serviceRegister, "account-service", serverPort);
}
```

> It is not a replacement for service registration in some integration tools like `Spring Cloud ZooKeeper`.
> We try to keep compatibility of discovering any service instances registered via `Curator Framework`.
